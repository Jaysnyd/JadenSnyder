# 📚 WGU & Personal Projects Repository

Welcome! This repository is a collection of personal and academic projects I've worked on throughout my time as a student at **Western Governors University (WGU)**, as well as independent projects I've created to explore and grow as a software developer.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A **learning archive** of my journey through software engineering and development.
- A **portfolio** to showcase my progress and skills to potential employers, mentors, and collaborators.
- A **sandbox** for experimentation and continuous improvement.

## 🧰 Technologies Explored So Far

- **Web Development**  
  `HTML`, `CSS` – Responsive layouts, basic web pages, and user interface design.

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**  
  `Python` – Implementations of common algorithms and data structures.

- **UI/UX Design**  
  Wireframes, mockups, and usability principles (tools may include Figma or Adobe XD).

## 🚀 Future Technologies

As I continue my degree and learning path, I'll be adding projects using:

- `Java`
- `Spring Boot`
- `Databases` (SQL, NoSQL)
- `REST APIs`
- `Cloud platforms` (AWS, GCP, etc.)
- `Version Control & DevOps`

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder will include:
- Source code
- A dedicated README for that project
- Screenshots or demo links when available
